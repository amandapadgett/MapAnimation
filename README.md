# Real Time Bus Tracker

<a class="dropdown-item" href="https://amandapadgett.github.io/MapAnimation/">Run the Real Time Bus Tracker</a>

## Description:

This project uses Mapbox map overlay, along with actual latitude and longitude coordinates of bus stops retrieved from MBTA website(Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority), to show all stops the between MIT and Harvard.

## How to Run:

To begin the journey, click the button at the top of the screen, and the marker will move from one bus stop to the next between the two schools. Refresh the page to start over.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:

The next thing I plan to do is display an overlay of the the actual city, as well chart a difference course, such as to historic places in the city.

Editing this to add that I did make a map tour of the places I spent a lot of time at while going to school at Clemson University (1990-1994). You can view that map <a href="https://amandapadgett.github.io/ClemsonUnivWalk/">here</a>.
